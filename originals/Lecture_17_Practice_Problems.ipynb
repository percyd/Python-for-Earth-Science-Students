    "- Use pandas to read in the tab separated file Datasets/ZirconData.txt. These data are from Bisnath et al (2006) and were downloaded from the Pangaea database (https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.847015)\n",

    "- The columns \\['Age dated \\[ka\\] (Age, 206Pb/238U Lead-Uranium)'\\] and \\['Age dated \\[ka\\] (Age, 207Pb/206Pb Lead-Lead)'\\] are the different age systems. Get the mean of each of these ages.\n",
    "- Use **plt.hist()** to plot a histogram of both age dates.\n",
    "- Use **sns.kdeplot()** to plot a kernel density of both age systems. Experiment with the **bw** argument to see how this alters your result. According to the seaborn documentation, the bandwidth (bw) parameter of the KDE controls how tightly the estimation is fit to the data, much like the bin size in a histogram. It corresponds to the width of the kernels we plotted above. The default behavior tries to guess a good value using a common reference rule, but it may be helpful to try larger or smaller values:\n",
