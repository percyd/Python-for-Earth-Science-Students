    "There is a lot of leeway in choosing variable names in Python, but there are some guidelines and outright rules. Here are some tips about variable names:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Variable names are composed of alphanumeric characters, including '-' and '\\_'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) They are case sensitive:  'a' is not the same as 'A'.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) There are some _reserved words_ in Python that you may not use as your variable names because they have pre-defined meanings (for example,  _False_ or _True_)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of reserved words: \n",
    "\n",
    "|  and |  assert | break  | class  | continue  |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "|def\t\t| del\t| \telif\t| else\t\t| except\t| \n",
    "|exec\t| \tfinally\t\t| for\t\t| from\t\t| global\t| \n",
    "|if\t\t| import\t| \tin\t\t| is\t\t| lambda\t| \n",
    "|not\t| \tor\t| \tpass\t| \tprint\t| \traise\t| \n",
    "|return\t| \ttry\t\t| while\t\t| \n",
    "\n",
    "Do NOT use any of the following words either (although they are not strictly Python reserved words, they conflict with the names of commonly-used Python functions):\n",
    "\n",
    "|Data\t|Float|\tInt|Numeric\t|\n",
    "|----|-----|---- |-----|\n",
    "|array|\tclose\t|float\t|int|\tinput|\n",
    "|open|\trange|\ttype|\twrite\t|zeros|\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also avoid all the names defined in commonly-used Python code libraries like: \n",

    "|exp\t|fabs\t|floor\t|log|\tlog10|\n",
    "|pi|\tsin|\tsqrt\t|tan\t|\n",

    "4) There are few rules for variable names except for avoiding reserved words, but there are \"best practices\".  In general, longer more descriptive words are better because they'll remind you what the variable stores. \n",
    "\n",
    "5) Here are some \"best practices\" for variable names:\n",
    "https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions\n",

    "- mixedCase \n",
    "\n",
    "Use these upper case options for constants\n",
    "- UPPERCASE  \n",
    "- UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES -\n",
    "\n",
    "Other options:\n",
    "- CapitalizedWords (or CapWords, or CamelCase -- so named because of the bumpy look of its letters). This is also sometimes known as StudlyCaps. - this is for _classes_ which we will learn about later.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Don't use this, it's ugly!\n",
    "- Capitalized_Words_With_Underscores \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, some things to avoid:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't use characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names. These are easily confused in some fonts with '1' (one), '0' (zero), for example.  If you really want a letter 'el', use 'L'.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't use non-standard symbols like $^{\\circ}$ or $\\sim$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Be careful with special names that use leading or trailing underscores.  these are treated differently by Python and you have to know what you are doing before you use them.  "
